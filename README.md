# Temperature-Forecasting-Using-DMD

Forecasting temperature has many implications since temperature variation in one location might have a significant impact on that particular area. This essay seeks to project.Utilizing Dynamic Mode Decomposition, temperature (DMD). The DMD method is entirely data-driven. The future behaviour of the system can be predicted using the DMD modes that capture its dynamic activity. The ARIMA model, RNNs, and other machine learning algorithms, among others, can be used to predict temperatures. DMD doesn't need any training, in contrast to currently utilized machine learning methods. The use of DMD for this purpose has not been extensively studied in the literature.

This project used daily temperature data to forecast the weather for the following few days. A different sampling window was used for the prediction. The Root Mean Squared Error was used to calculate the error.
